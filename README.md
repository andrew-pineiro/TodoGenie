[![Build and Test TodoGenie](https://github.com/andrew-pineiro/TodoGenie/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andrew-pineiro/TodoGenie/actions/workflows/action.yml)

## Purpose
Generate GitHub issues based off of your commented TODO's. 

## Install Guide
Download the proper Release for your OS, and run it from the terminal in any `.git` directory.

## Build
When starting with the source code, all you need to do is run `make build` to build the application.

## Powershell Module
Run the `build.ps1` file in the `powershell/` directory. Once you reload powershell, you can type Get-Module TodoGenie to pull in the command Invoke-Genie or igen. This command needs to be run in a directory that contains a .git folder or specify that directory as an argument.
